- Server Request Handlers
- Database Queries For Persistent Storage
## Before Starting

1. Fork this repo and clone it.
1. Continue your work and push up changes as you progress.

## Guidelines

This benchmark will be evaluated as if it was a coding challenge given to you as part of a job application process. Not only will the functionality of your code be important, but also, the professionalism with which you write it. Consider the style and organization of your code. Make frequent commits with informative and consistent commit messages. Be professional and informative with your comments.

This directory holds the benchmark in the directory labeled instapost. This is the application directory and will hold a README with details on the benchmark.

## Available resources

The ultimate goal of this benchmark is to give you an opportunity to demonstrate your abilities as an engineer. Avoid anything that will obscure our ability and your ability to see your best efforts at work.

* You **may not** use a scaffolding tool (e.g. Yeoman) or starter repos unless specifically allowed in a prompt's README
* You **may not** use any resources created at Hack Reactor by yourself, other students, or staff members
  * e.g. lectures, sprints, MVP, past assessments, side projects, notes, mentor assignments, etc.
* You **may** only use online resources specifically allowed in a prompt's README
* You **may not** copy and paste from available online resources
